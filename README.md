Project Vision
To build an AI-powered musical companion application that acts as an interactive partner for a musician during a live performance. The app will listen to the music being created in real-time, offer intelligent suggestions for arrangement (like adding bass or drums), and provide feedback through a cute, animated avatar. The user interface should be simple, intuitive, and designed for hands-free use.

## ðŸŽµ Music Companion Features

### Creative AI Partner
The app now features an intelligent Music Companion that transforms from a passive observer to an active creative collaborator:

- **Real-Time Creative Suggestions**: Instead of just describing what it hears, the AI provides specific, actionable suggestions for enhancing your music
- **Three Suggestion Modes**:
  - **Enhance Mode**: Provides specific improvements for existing music
  - **Create Mode**: Helps build tracks from scratch with genre-appropriate suggestions  
  - **Experiment Mode**: Suggests creative, genre-bending ideas for unique tracks

### Interactive Prompt System
The companion uses advanced prompting strategies:

1. **The Creative Collaborator**: Acts as your bandmate, giving three distinct enhancement ideas
2. **The Genre-Aware Expert**: Provides style-specific suggestions (drums, bass, harmony)
3. **The Interactive Auditioner**: Offers multiple variations for specific parts

### Enhanced UI for Creative Feedback
- **Structured Suggestion Display**: Creative suggestions are displayed in organized cards with:
  - Instrument and technique specifications
  - Style descriptions and reasoning
  - Overall feedback and next steps
- **Real-Time Music Analysis**: Live detection of tempo, key, genre, mood, and instruments
- **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced status indicators for music vs. voice detection

Core Features
Animated UI: The central interface is a friendly, animated character that dances to the music and visually communicates feedback and suggestions.

Real-Time Audio Analysis: The app will use the device microphone to listen to and analyze brand-new music as it's being played. It needs to identify key musical elements such as:

Chord progressions

Tempo (BPM)

Key signature

Intelligent Music Suggestions: Based on its analysis of the user's playing, the app will proactively suggest musical enhancements. For example, it might ask, "Want to add some drums?"

Interactive Auditioning: When a suggestion is made, the app will generate and play several variations for the user to hear (e.g., three distinct drum patterns).

AI-Powered Feedback Loop: The user can then try to play along with or perform their own version of a suggested part. The app will listen, analyze the user's performance, and select the "best" take based on criteria like rhythmic stability and stylistic fit. The avatar will then react positively to the chosen take.

Voice-Activated Controls: The primary method of interaction should be voice commands (e.g., "Yes, add drums") to ensure a seamless experience for the musician while they are playing.

Technical Requirements
The application will need to integrate several types of AI services via APIs:

Real-Time Audio Analysis: An API capable of processing a live audio stream to extract musical data (chords, tempo, key). This is for analyzing original music, not recognizing existing songs.

AI Music Generation: An API to create short, original musical loops on demand (e.g., bass lines, drum beats) based on genre, key, and tempo parameters.

Instrument Separation (Stem Splitting): An API to isolate specific instrument tracks from an audio mix for more detailed analysis.
